# EEGspindles
Sleep spindles occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The aim of present project was to detect sleep spindles and 
calculate the following features: spindle density, spindle activity (duration*amplitude) and spindle instantaneous frequency. 

When you run the myspindles function, the program will ask for an edf file which should only contain one stage of sleep.
It could be a concatenated Stage 2 or Stage 3 sleep EEG data. You can find the outputs, for each electrode, in csv files. 
You will also get an output for average values.
